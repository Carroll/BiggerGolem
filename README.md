# Bigger Golem

Bigger Golem is an extension that aims to bring a variety of improvements to the popular turn-based board game site [Little Golem](https://www.littlegolem.net/). At the moment, it supports the following features:

- Icon badge shows how many games it is your turn in (contributed by [xentac](https://github.com/xentac))
- Configurable piece sets for Shogi
- Configurable (and resizable) piece sets for Chess
- Configurable piece sets and board color for Reversi (contributed by [Trevor Cook](https://github.com/tdcook))
- Coordinates for Go boards (contributed by [Mathijs Claassen](https://github.com/mathijsclaassen))

More features are under active development.

This extension is entirely made by a fan of LG and is not officially associated with LG or Richard Malaschitz in any way.
